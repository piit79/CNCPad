# Sub-Etha Pad

![Sub-Etha Pad 0.95](https://github.com/piit79/Sub-Etha-Pad/raw/main/sub-etha-pad-m/Sub-Etha-Pad-M.jpg)

Mechanical macropad with a large "CNC" rotary encoder. Uses Pro Micro controller (or 
compatible, like Elite-C, nice!nano etc.)

Inspired by [EncoderPad RP2040](https://github.com/jpconstantineau/EncoderPad_RP2040),
but created from scratch in KiCad 6.

Instead of an FR4 (PCB) sandwich case, it uses a layered acrylic case made from 5 mm sheets.

Kits will be available at [42keebs.eu](https://42keebs.eu/) some time in August 2022.

**Work in progress - currently untested!**
